# Organization

When working in a team, it is crucial to have a good way to share files, code and ressources
with other members of the team. In this chapter, we explain what tools we used and how
we organized our workflow for a good cooperation.

To share code, we use [GitHub](https://github.com/Ecam-Eurobot) and [`git`](https://git-scm.com/),
we have a shared Fusion360 project to store our 3D models and we have a Google Drive / OneDrive to
store all other files.
